	<p>
		Hey ðŸ‘‹, I&apos;m Mayer, a full-stack developer ðŸš€. I lead a team of mobile
		and web developers in the Israeli Defence Forces.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our work involves understanding the specific processes of our organization
		and engineering systems that enhance and automate their workflows. We
		specialize in creating solutions that collect, analyze, and visualize data
		with the aim of improving decision-making.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to my development role, a significant part of my
		responsibilities involves studying our clients&apos; business processes to
		create BPDs and plan database infrastructure to make sure we implement the
		most appropriate technologies to our solutions. Moreover, I am actively
		involved in educating new recruits about our technology stack, ensuring they
		are well-equipped and knowledgeable for their roles after my departure.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am passionate about building and designing. Crafting apps that offer an
		incredible experience for both developers and users is something I find
		truly rewarding.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a particular fondness for static types, especially Rust and
		TypeScript.
	</p>
	<p>
		Above all, I&apos;m a self-learner. I enjoy working on my personal projects
		and staying up to date with new technologies and frameworks - with htmx,
		SvelteKit, and Remix currently topping my list of interests.
